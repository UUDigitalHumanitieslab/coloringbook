    <p>Welcome to the Coloringbook administration interface.</p>
    
    <h3>How to create new surveys</h3>
    
    <p>You can upload recorded sentences (in MP3 format) and prepared colorable SVG files to the <a href="soundview">Sounds</a> and <a href="drawingview">Drawings</a> tabs, respectively. After uploading a drawing, it is necessary to edit it (by clicking on a pencil icon at the left side of the list) in order to identify all colorable areas. You need to do this only once per uploaded drawing.</p>
    
    <p>Once the required media have been uploaded, you can create a coloringbook <a href="pageview">Page</a> by combining a drawing with a recorded sentence and/or a written sentence. You can re-use drawings and recordings as many times as you want. By default, the sentence is played and/or displayed for three seconds, after which the drawing is shown and the test subject can start coloring it. You can however opt to play/display the sentences at the same time as the drawing by clicking the &ldquo;Simultaneous&rdquo; checkbox when creating a survey (see below).</p>
    
    <p>It is possible to express your expectations about a page by editing it, again with the pencil icon. The actual behaviour of your test subjects is automatically compared with your expectations. You can also change the sentence in the editing form, but it is recommended to not do this after the page is published to test subjects.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, pages can be bundled in a <a href="surveyview">Survey</a>. At your option, you may either set a starting date for the survey, before which the survey will be unavailable to test subjects, or an ending date, after which the survey will become unavailable, or both. The &ldquo;Simultaneous&rdquo; checkbox determines whether drawings are shown three seconds after the sentence (unchecked, default) or at the same time as the drawing (checked). The &ldquo;Information&rdquo; field can contain any comments that you may want to add about the survey. The &ldquo;Pages&rdquo; fields lets you order the pages that you add by drag and drop; test subjects are presented with the pages in the same order.</p>
    
    <p>The name of a survey also determines the URL at which your survey becomes available to test subjects (between the optional begin and end dates). For example, if your survey is called &ldquo;example&rdquo;, then test subjects have to follow this link in order to take it:</p>
    
    <blockquote><a href="/book/example" id="replace_origin">
        http://yourdomain.org/book/example
    </a></blockquote>
    
    <h3>How to obtain the data</h3>
    
    <p>All actions that test subjects take, up to the exact time in milliseconds since the drawing appeared, are stored and can be accessed in the <a href="fillview">Data</a> tab. This tab also allows you to sort and filter the data. You can export the (possibly filtered) data to a CSV format which works well with both Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS. There are three flavours of export: <emph>raw</emph>, where the data are simply exported as shown, <emph>final</emph>, where the final results for each area and each subject are exported together with additional information such as the total number of clicks in the area and a comparision with your expectation, and <emph>compared</emph>, which is similar to final but takes your expectations as the starting point. The consequence is that final includes data of coloring actions in areas about which you didn't express any expectations, while compared includes entries for areas in which you expressed expectations, but which weren't colored by test subjects.</p>
